## Running Locally

For users who wish to modify the Python scripts and execute each individually, you may use the following commands to run the script via command line:

```Bash
# create new virtual environment
python -m venv env

# activate virtual environment
source env\bin\activate

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# execute program
python <filename.py>
```  

For other users who wish to run the code for creating the pull/transfer lists (**ral-pull-transfer.exe**):  
1.  Open Windows Command Prompt
    - Press the Windows key and search for "Command Prompt"
    - Alternatively, you may also open File Explorer to navigate to the folder where you have the repository saved, click the far right of the top filepath breadcrumb menu, type in `cmd` and press `Enter` on your keyboard
        - This will open a Command Prompt window from your current folder
2.  Execute the following commands:
    ```Bash
    # 1) change into the directory where the code is stored
    cd <Your-Path-Here>\cu-hsl-ral-withdrawal

    # 2) run the executable
    .\dist\ral-pull-transfer.exe
    ```
>Note: 
> - Depending on the amount of files (and records in the files) being processed, the program may take anywhere from several minutes to several hours to run.  
>  - You will know it is complete when you see a message like the following: `[Processing time: xyz sec]`.  
> - Also pay attention to any runtime errors/exceptions that may cause the program execution to fail.  These will the require action by the user to potentially fix some issue (whether it be formatting or some other anomaly) and manually execute the program again.
> - Ensure you have completed the pre-requisite steps before executing the script.
